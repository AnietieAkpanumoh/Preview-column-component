## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to structure my html using the semantic html and I also learned how to write media queries for responsiveness. I imported the font-family to css using the import option which I did not know before.

### Continued development

I want to learn more css grid and media queries for responsiveness. That seem to be my challenge now.
